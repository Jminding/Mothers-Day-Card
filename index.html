    <p>Dear 엄마,<br><br>
    Thank you so much for all the hard work you've done over the years.  Every day, you cook, clean, and take care of me.  I really appreciate it.<br>
    Because of you, I was able to learn so much and do so much better in life.  Even though I sometimes drive you crazy, I know it's because you love me.<br>
    I am really thankful for all that you have done for me.  사랑해요, 엄마!<br><br><p align="right">Love,<br>정민이</p></p>
